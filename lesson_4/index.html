				The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed.
			</p>
			<p class="style02">
				The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family.
			</p>
			<p class="style03">
				It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and
				is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.
			</p>
			<p class="saturation01">
				Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled
				pulling, and companionship.[2]
			</p>
			<p class="saturation02">
				It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the
				extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic.
			</p>
			<p class="saturation03">
				William Goosak, a Russian fur trader,
				introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields
				and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.[2]
			</p>
			<p class="saturation04">
				Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as
				a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushe.

			<p class="alignment02">
				The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern
				Siberia.[6]
			</p>
			<p class="alignment03">
				They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually
				developed and used for sled dog racing.[7][8]
			</p>
			<p class="alignment04">
				In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the
				Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were
				related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia.

			<p class="design01">
				They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo
				Dog and the Greenland Dog.
			</p>
			<p class="design02">
				In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their
				Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through
				crossing with European breeds.[8]
			</p>
			<p class="design03">
				Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian
				dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old.[9] Several
				Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct
				Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture.

			<p class="shadow">
				These breeds are associated with high latitudes – the Siberian
				Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei
				and Finnish Spitz.
			</p>
			<p class="register01">
				There is data to indicate admixture of between 1–3% between the Taymyr wolf population
				and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds.
			</p>
			<p class="register02">
				This introgression could have provided
				early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and
				challenging environment.

			<p class="register03">
				It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than

			<p class="interval">
				Sable female Siberian Husky
				A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds.[11] It has two
				layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs.[12] It
				protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able
				to withstand temperatures as low as −50 to −60 °C (−58 to −76 °F).
			</p>
			<p class="retreat">
				The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.[11] An excessively
				long coat, sometimes referred to as a "wooly" or "woolie" coat, is considered a fault by the breed's
				standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut
				outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted
				with snow and ice. [13]
			</p>
			<p class="spaces">
				Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial markings,
				and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and
				the rare "agouti" coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting.
			</p>
			<p class="word">
				Some other individuals
				also have the "saddle back" pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area
				while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other
				facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed.[12][14][15][16]
				Merle coat patterns are not permitted by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and The Kennel Club (KC).[12][17]
				This pattern is often associated with health issues and impure breeding.[18]
